**qPCR** is a highly sensitive and accurate method for gene expression quantification. However, there can be some common issues in qPCR experiments. Here are some common problems and their analysis and solutions:

1. High or Low Ct Values, Amplification Efficiency:
   - Analysis: This might be due to low template DNA concentration, primer design issues, suboptimal reaction conditions, or the presence of PCR inhibitors.
   - Solution: Check template quality and concentration; redesign primers and verify primer quality; optimize reaction conditions such as annealing temperature, Mg concentration, and primer concentration; perform template purification to remove potential inhibitors.
2. Unstable Amplification Curves:
   - Analysis: Low template purity, the presence of impurities in the reaction, prolonged instrument use, lack of ROX.
   - Solution: Use high-quality templates; calibrate the instrument; use SYBR Green qPCR reagents containing ROX.
3. Large Ct Value Fluctuations:
   - Analysis: Errors in the experimental process or differences between experimental replicates may be the cause.
   - Solution: Ensure standardization and precision in experimental procedures; increase the number of experimental replicates for improved data reliability; minimize operational and temperature fluctuations during experimental steps.
4. Inconsistent Amplification Curves Between Replicates:
   - Analysis: Errors in experimental operations, unstable primer amplification efficiency, or inconsistencies in reaction components may contribute.
   - Solution: Enhance standardized and consistent experimental procedures; redesign primers and verify primer quality; ensure consistency and quality of reaction components.
5. Low or Non-linear Standard Curve Correlation Coefficient:
   - Analysis: This may result from an inappropriate template concentration range, issues with the quality of standard samples, or experimental operation errors.
   - Solution: Re-select the template concentration range to ensure it falls within the optimal range; check the quality of standard samples; ensure the precision and consistency of experimental operations.
6. High Fluorescent Background or Irregular Amplification Curves:
   - Analysis: Problems with primer or probe quality, fluorescent signal interference, or experimental operation errors may be the culprits.
   - Solution: Check the quality of primers and probes; replace fluorescent probes; optimize experimental procedures; ensure the instrument settings are correct.
7. Multiple Peaks in the Melting Curve:
   - Analysis: Non-specific amplification may be the cause, likely due to primer design issues, low annealing temperature, or suboptimal choice of polymerase.
   - Solution: Redesign primers to improve specificity; optimize reaction conditions, such as increasing the annealing temperature; select a polymerase with higher fidelity.
8. Primer dimer:
   - Analysis: Possibly due to low gene expression levels.
   - Solution: Increase the amount of templates appropriately.

9. Little or no PCR product:
   - Analysis: The PCR template, primers, or reagents may be of poor quality. Another possibility is that the gene may not be expressed or may be expressed at a very low level in certain tissues (or at a certain stage).
   - Solution: Please use appropriate PCR controls to eliminate these factors.
