    <p><strong>qPCR</strong> is a highly sensitive and accurate method for gene expression quantification. However,
        there can be some common issues in qPCR experiments. Here are some common problems and their analysis and
        solutions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>High or Low Ct Values, Amplification Efficiency:
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis: This might be due to low template DNA concentration, primer design issues, suboptimal
                    reaction conditions, or the presence of PCR inhibitors.</li>
                <li>Solution: Check template quality and concentration; redesign primers and verify primer quality;
                    optimize reaction conditions such as annealing temperature, Mg concentration, and primer
                    concentration; perform template purification to remove potential inhibitors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Unstable Amplification Curves:
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis: Low template purity, the presence of impurities in the reaction, prolonged instrument use,
                    lack of ROX.</li>
                <li>Solution: Use high-quality templates; calibrate the instrument; use SYBR Green qPCR reagents
                    containing ROX.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Large Ct Value Fluctuations:
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis: Errors in the experimental process or differences between experimental replicates may be
                    the cause.</li>
                <li>Solution: Ensure standardization and precision in experimental procedures; increase the number of
                    experimental replicates for improved data reliability; minimize operational and temperature
                    fluctuations during experimental steps.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Inconsistent Amplification Curves Between Replicates:
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis: Errors in experimental operations, unstable primer amplification efficiency, or
                    inconsistencies in reaction components may contribute.</li>
                <li>Solution: Enhance standardized and consistent experimental procedures; redesign primers and verify
                    primer quality; ensure consistency and quality of reaction components.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Low or Non-linear Standard Curve Correlation Coefficient:
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis: This may result from an inappropriate template concentration range, issues with the
                    quality of standard samples, or experimental operation errors.</li>
                <li>Solution: Re-select the template concentration range to ensure it falls within the optimal range;
                    check the quality of standard samples; ensure the precision and consistency of experimental
                    operations.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>High Fluorescent Background or Irregular Amplification Curves:
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis: Problems with primer or probe quality, fluorescent signal interference, or experimental
                    operation errors may be the culprits.</li>
                <li>Solution: Check the quality of primers and probes; replace fluorescent probes; optimize experimental
                    procedures; ensure the instrument settings are correct.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Multiple Peaks in the Melting Curve:
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis: Non-specific amplification may be the cause, likely due to primer design issues, low
                    annealing temperature, or suboptimal choice of polymerase.</li>
                <li>Solution: Redesign primers to improve specificity; optimize reaction conditions, such as increasing
                    the annealing temperature; select a polymerase with higher fidelity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Primer dimer:
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis: Possibly due to low gene expression levels.</li>
                <li>Solution: Increase the amount of templates appropriately.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Little or no PCR product:
            <ul>
                <li>Analysis: The PCR template, primers, or reagents may be of poor quality. Another possibility is that
                    the gene may not be expressed or may be expressed at a very low level in certain tissues (or at a
                    certain stage).</li>
                <li>Solution: Please use appropriate PCR controls to eliminate these factors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
